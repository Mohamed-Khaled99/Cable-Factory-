# Cable-Factory-
💡 From Raw data to Actionable Insights: Bridging Data Analysis & Process Engineering

In my latest practice project, I combined my experience as a Process Engineer at Elsewedy Cables with Data Analysis to simulate and analyze a cable manufacturing plant’s production, scrap, and quality performance.

Here’s how I did it:
⿡ Data Generation — Created fake sample data using ChatGPT to simulate real factory operations. (No real production data was used.)

⿢ Data Modeling — Structured & cleaned the data to build a clear database model.

⿣ SQL View — Built specific views to combine production & quality data for meaningful analysis.

⿤ Visualization — Used Power BI to build dashboards showing production efficiency, scrap trends, and quality KPIs.

🔍 Key Goal: Connect raw (even simulated) data to practical operational decisions — exactly what a Process Engineer needs to improve productivity and reduce waste.

I believe combining Data Analytics with Process Engineering is the way forward for smarter manufacturing.
